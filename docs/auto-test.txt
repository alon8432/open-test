1.Issues that need resolving：
To ensure that from the boot hardware to the software a series of hardware and software are fully in place and ready.


2．Device status detection Purpose: to ensure that the system hardware environment with the normal working state and speed.

CPU frequency, core number of automatic detection
MEM frequency, SIZE, bandwidth automatic detection
Hard disk number, size, read and write speed, automatic detection
All PCI devices are in place for detection.
Focus on PCI device register level detection. (FPGA, LAN, GPU, VGA,)
Switch status detection,
Network channel normal detection (all nodes ping each other), each node communication speed is normal.


3．Operating System Level Detection Purpose: To ensure that the operating system level has entered the normal working condition.
 Essential process detection,
 Essential services testing,
 The necessary read and write and operation permission detection,
T he necessary system library testing,
　　　
4．Driver in-place detection Purpose: Ensure that all driver-level software has entered the normal working state
Whether the system operating the driver is in place,
Key drivers (FPGA, GPU, LAN),
Has installed detection, version information detection, switch read and write detection, and speed detection,
   Hardware and software coordinated detection, and hardware status information detection.

6．Software program prerequisite condition detection: destination to determine the software program has been working with the state.
Whether the software process to open the automatic detection,
Whether the process daemon is present or not.
Software / hardware watchdog
Database software, their respective third-party software,
Whether it has been started and running in the normal state.
　　
５．[Optional] to complete the system after the system automatically up and down, restart to do the second test,
So, the system after the start of their own automatic detection and mutual communication detection,
Can ensure that the system modules and system software, drivers, applications, guardian
Have entered the normal working condition.

6．error report:
Hardware part of the error report: power, computing, switching, storage,
    (Cpu, mem, hdd, lan, fpga, gpu, vga) - (exist, count, size, speed, error)
Drive part of the error report: (exist, open, read, write, close, dma)
System part error report: (interupt, error, process, service, lib)
Application Partial Error Report: (...)

7．Automatic repair:
  Hardware: reboot, power up and down. The The Repair try
System: reboot, power up and down. The The Repair try
Drive: uninstall, load, restart the device. The The try
Application: KILL, reload. The The try

After the self-test, error reporting, automatic repair, 
enhance and ensure that the system running the hardware and software environment is normal.
